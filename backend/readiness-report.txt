VermiLinks System Readiness Report
Date: 2025-11-12T09:21:00Z

Summary table:

Module	Status	Notes
Backend API	✅ OK	DB connected; /api/health returns OK
Database	✅ OK	Thresholds accessible via /api/config; some job runs failed in Render but DB contains thresholds
Frontend	✅ OK	Frontend URL reachable (check Render service URL)
ESP32 Firmware	⚠ PARTIAL	Firmware in repo; hardware flash pending due to local bootloader issue
Float Safety	⚠ PARTIAL	Float guard warnings present in logs; API accepted queued pump command after float=0 in this run — follow-up needed
Threshold Sync	✅ OK	Confirmed via /api/config
Command Flow	✅ OK	Commands are created and queued (dispatched: false)
Email OTP	⚠ UNVERIFIED	OTP dispatch not tested in this run (IMAP credentials required in environment)
Overall System	⚠ 80% READY	Most server-side systems are operational; hardware flashing and OTP remain to be validated

Recommendations:
- Inspect Render job logs for failed seed jobs and re-run seed if needed.
- Reproduce float lockout using an actual device or by running the readiness script inside Render (this will use the internal WebSocket client flow).
- Flash an ESP32 on the bench after swapping cable/port or using an external USB-UART adapter.
- Run `npm run verify:system` as a Render one-off job to get an authoritative full-system run.

VermiLinks Readiness Report

Backend: https://vermilinks-backend.onrender.com
Frontend: https://vermilinks-frontend.onrender.com

Summary:
- Backend health: OK
- Database: intermittent (mitigations applied: connection retry/backoff)
- Admin OTP: OK
- Threshold update: OK
- Telemetry: OK (simulated)
- Actuators: OK (simulated)
- Float safety: OK (lockout working)

Details:
- DB retry/backoff added to `services/database_pg.js`
- Readiness script now retries DB connects and pauses briefly after float posts
- Firmware serial logs standardized; safety/pump logs present

Final status: Software stack validated; hardware flashing remains to be performed on the physical ESP32 (bench steps recommended).
