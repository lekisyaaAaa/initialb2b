// LEGACY: validate_migration.js
// This validation script was removed from the runnable tree as part of the
// Postgres-only cleanup (Option A). The original script is preserved in the
// repository history (use `git log -- backend/legacy_migrations/validate_migration.js`)
// and can be restored if you need to compare MongoDB and Postgres counts.
// Restore from git history and set MONGODB_URI before running.
